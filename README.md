# 41189 My Reflective Portfolio 
## Week 1 

## What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection and taking into consideration that this was my first lesson of human-centred complex systems, it was observed that I found it rather difficult and overwhelming. This was because the topics discussed in the lesson although some were familiar, the rest was very new and this made it harder to grasp the numerous concepts explored. However, the subject was fascinating and I gained insight into the concept of "systems". I have learnt that systems comprise of multiple elements which makes it complex to simply define it a such. These various aspects of a system must possess a significant relationship and be interlinked to each other and are designed to perform a function. Moreover, insights into types systems were also gained such as open systems, closed systems and isolated systems. Furthermore, the characteristics of a complex system learnt and how they show self-organisation and emergence.

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In all honestly, the subject was entirely new for me therefore most concepts could be considered as foreign. The way I perceived a system to be was different and rather more complex and descriptive than what I had in my knowledge. Therefore, I have gained a deeper knowledge into systems and their complexity and depth. 

## What insights have I gained?
As mentioned previously, I have gained a deeper insight into systems in relation to what they are and how there are numerous forms of systems. My perceptions towards systems being a very simple aspect to them possessing multiple elements was significantly insightful. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
By participating in this workshop, I have noted that my strength was understanding the basis of systems by reflecting upon my performance. However, I found the various concepts discussed in the workshop were rather difficult to grasp and properly understand at once and this can be regarded as my weakness. The area around complex systems was at first very difficult to comprehend. Moreover, I have released my inability to stay focused and lose interest in the subject due to it being 3 hours long. This interest in the subject is increased as time passes by. 
 
## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
By reflecting upon my performance in the workshop, it can be noted that my strengths weren’t very prominent. This is considering the fact that I found the workshop itself fairly difficult in relation to understanding the various concepts discussed. However, after reviewing the content material, I gained a deeper insight and was able to understand complex systems. In relation to my weakness, it can be related to my inability of having to pay attention to a 3-hour workshop with full focus and not be distracted. This lack of attention affected my retention of the subject material.  

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I could be considering grasping the content of the content as a challenging aspect of the entire subject.  This was due to the fact most concepts were foreign and hard to understand simply.  Moreover, as mentioned above, having to pay attention for 3 hours was another major challenge as I would get distracted a lot.  This challenge was dealt with reading through the subject content after the workshop to better comprehend the harder concepts and talk to members of my group if I had any doubts to be clarified. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time my aim is to listen better and pay more detailed attention to the class which can immensely aid in intensifying my understanding of the content showcased. Moreso, I aim to write dot point notes of key concepts which can further aid me. In doing so, I can perfect my time management and perform at a higher standard in the subject. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The main theory I believe that could assist me in performing better in this subject was making notes. This was because this subject involved numerous concepts that are very new to me, therefore note-taking is highly significant. Moreover, keeping up to date with assignment due dates is highly essential for this subject to be organised and manage time and effort effectively. I have used this theory for other subjects and it was highly beneficial, therefore, I am confident that it will work for this subject as well.  




## Week 2

## What have I learnt this week?
By thoroughly reflecting upon my learning of week 2’s content, I have learned about the “Many models thinking” approach. It enabled me to learn about models in general and in terms of the types of models and the uses of models. As I have delved deeper, I was able to comprehend the ease that is accompanied by models and how they improve the thinking of one. Moreover, I was able to understand how models enable individuals to become better thinkers. This was intriguing for me as I was able to come into terms of how models assist in communicating information and allow readers to explain phenomena. It was surprising to learn how models impose logical coherence and how they assist in strategic decision making and forecasting. To enhance this learning, I have learnt the various types of models such as the embodiment approach, analogy approach and the alternative reality approach.  Moreover, I gained knowledge in relation to the seven uses of models (reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict and explore). To add to this, the overall science behind models was also learnt during this workshop. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In all honesty, I didn’t possess any knowledge in relation to models and how much depth is to that spectrum of information. Therefore, everything that was grasped about models in relation to how they improve the thinking of an individual was all very foreign to me.   I didn’t know the importance of models in our society and how it is used to communicate information. Overall,  I didn’t know much about models, hence, even the slightest of the information was new. 

## What insights have I gained?
In relation to insights, the overall insight about models was gained this week. As mentioned above, I gained insights into the importance of models. I found the Condorcet jury theorem and diversity prediction theorem highly insightful. It was highly intriguing to see calculations involved in these theorems. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
By participating in this workshop, I have noted that my strength was understanding the basis of models by reflecting upon my performance. However, I found the various concepts discussed in the workshop were rather difficult to grasp and properly understand at once and this can be regarded as my weakness. The area around the Condorcet Jury Theorem and diversity prediction theorem were very difficult yet insightful to comprehend in relation to the calculation.  Moreover, I have released my inability to stay focused and lose interest in the subject due to it being 3 hours long. This was the same weakness as last week due to a lack of attention span. 
 
## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Similarly to last week's workshop, grasping the content of what was taught was a challenging aspect of it. Considering the heavy content involved in this subject and the foreign concept of models, it was hard to comprehend all of it at once. Just like last time, my inability to stay focused for 3 hours straight was also challenging because it is hard to stay focused all throughout the lesson.  However, I dealt with this challenge by reading over the module 2 content and when some parts became challenging to understand, I took assistance from friends who do the subject with me.  Moreover, taking notes for key concepts also assisted dealing with the challenges accompanied with the concepts. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Reflecting upon last week, I wanted to listen better and pay more attention to the lesson and what the tutor was saying to better comprehend the content. However, I failed to do that therefore, this goal also applies for next week. I tried to incorporate my aim of making notes which was helpful and I continue to do that all lessons throughout to strengthen my understanding. This will enable me to maintain consistency. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Similarly to last week, I believe that key note taking is important and useful to assist me with the subject content and understanding. Considering the innumerable foreign concepts involved on this subject such as this workshop makes note taking predominant. Being well organised is key in this subject by keeping track of the assignment dates so that time is managed effectively. Note taking is a technique I use for all my subject units and it aids me immensely in understanding the concepts. 




## Week 3: 

## What have I learnt this week?
By reflecting upon what I learnt during the week 3 workshop, I began learning about thinking electrons and the three types of models (rational, behavioural, and rule-based). I further learnt about decision making and ways in which decision models relate to the way people make or should make certain decisions.  This led to discovering about normative reasons and positive reasons and the classes of problems. Signalling models was also a part of the learning this week. I have learnt that those types of models can identify conditions under which people send expensive signals to “reveal information or their type”. Furthermore, I also learnt about Value and power in terms of models that quantify those two aspects. It was great delving into problem solving and innovation in specific relation to how perspectives, heuristics, team diversity and recombination lead to innovation. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In similar relation to the past two weeks where the majority of concepts discussed in the lesson were unknown and rather intriguing. As I was learning more about models this week, I didn’t have any knowledge in relation to signalling models which was an unfamiliar topic. Although I knew about the basis of decision making at a surface level, I now know about normative reasons and positive reasons. I also now am aware of value and power and moreover, problem solving and innovation. Before these lessons, I wasn't aware of anything about these topics. 

## What insights have I gained?
I found it insightful that normative reasons relate to ways in which models are utilised to come up with prescriptions in order to make better decisions and about positive reasons in relation to the use of models to predict the behavior of others and reasoning behind people’s decision. It was also insightful to learn about signaling models as mentioned above in relation to their use. In my personal opinion and repeatedly speaking, considering the entire content although extension into models, consisted of more unfamiliar concepts which made everything learnt and rasped a new insight during this lesson. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
In relation to my strengths, since this week was branching off models from last week, my understanding of models from last week helped me in understanding this week’s content. However, the concepts discussed in this lesson were also hard to grasp and require more practice to gain understanding. To add to this, lack of attention span was also another weakness observed in this workshop due to the long duration of the workshop which made it fairly difficult to retain the information throughout. I have noticed that this has been a weakness since workshop one. 

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Similarly just like the past two workshops, being able to retain information and staying focused for three hours straight seems to always be a challenge. Therefore, for a change, instead of forcing myself to sit at the workshop for 3 hours, I took two 2-minute breaks in between to get some water or eat something, this enabled me to energise myself and thus I was able to focus on the workshop a bit better. However, there is still struggle to focus during the lessons but I observed that intervals help me focus better and thus strengthen my ability to retain the information that is being taught. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Reflecting upon this week, I believe that taking short breaks during the workshop was useful for retaining information.  I aim to maintain that consistency for upcoming workshops as that technique helped me in retaining information. This would ensure that I actually understand the workshop content and not lose interest. I had some doubts within this workshop wherein I had to ask my fellow mates to explain a few concepts. However next time, I aim to message the tutor and try to understand his points because I feel like his explanation would be more accurate. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Just like the past two weeks, it is proven that note taking is highly beneficial. This is due to the fact that as each module processes, the concepts seem to get harder and harder to process, therefore, consistent note taking helped me immensely. This week’s content of models seemed harder than last week where making notes helped me retain the information at a higher level and develop a better understanding.

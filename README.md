# 41189 My Reflective Portfolio 
## Week 1 

## What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection and taking into consideration that this was my first lesson of human-centred complex systems, it was observed that I found it rather difficult and overwhelming. This was because the topics discussed in the lesson although some were familiar, the rest was very new and this made it harder to grasp the numerous concepts explored. However, the subject was fascinating and I gained insight into the concept of "systems". I have learnt that systems comprise of multiple elements which makes it complex to simply define it a such. These various aspects of a system must possess a significant relationship and be interlinked to each other and are designed to perform a function. Moreover, insights into types systems were also gained such as open systems, closed systems and isolated systems. Furthermore, the characteristics of a complex system learnt and how they show self-organisation and emergence.

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In all honestly, the subject was entirely new for me therefore most concepts could be considered as foreign. The way I perceived a system to be was different and rather more complex and descriptive than what I had in my knowledge. Therefore, I have gained a deeper knowledge into systems and their complexity and depth. 

## What insights have I gained?
As mentioned previously, I have gained a deeper insight into systems in relation to what they are and how there are numerous forms of systems. My perceptions towards systems being a very simple aspect to them possessing multiple elements was significantly insightful. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
By participating in this workshop, I have noted that my strength was understanding the basis of systems by reflecting upon my performance. However, I found the various concepts discussed in the workshop were rather difficult to grasp and properly understand at once and this can be regarded as my weakness. The area around complex systems was at first very difficult to comprehend. Moreover, I have released my inability to stay focused and lose interest in the subject due to it being 3 hours long. This interest in the subject is increased as time passes by. 
 
## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
By reflecting upon my performance in the workshop, it can be noted that my strengths weren’t very prominent. This is considering the fact that I found the workshop itself fairly difficult in relation to understanding the various concepts discussed. However, after reviewing the content material, I gained a deeper insight and was able to understand complex systems. In relation to my weakness, it can be related to my inability of having to pay attention to a 3-hour workshop with full focus and not be distracted. This lack of attention affected my retention of the subject material.  

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I could be considering grasping the content of the content as a challenging aspect of the entire subject.  This was due to the fact most concepts were foreign and hard to understand simply.  Moreover, as mentioned above, having to pay attention for 3 hours was another major challenge as I would get distracted a lot.  This challenge was dealt with reading through the subject content after the workshop to better comprehend the harder concepts and talk to members of my group if I had any doubts to be clarified. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time my aim is to listen better and pay more detailed attention to the class which can immensely aid in intensifying my understanding of the content showcased. Moreso, I aim to write dot point notes of key concepts which can further aid me. In doing so, I can perfect my time management and perform at a higher standard in the subject. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The main theory I believe that could assist me in performing better in this subject was making notes. This was because this subject involved numerous concepts that are very new to me, therefore note-taking is highly significant. Moreover, keeping up to date with assignment due dates is highly essential for this subject to be organised and manage time and effort effectively. I have used this theory for other subjects and it was highly beneficial, therefore, I am confident that it will work for this subject as well.  




## Week 2

## What have I learnt this week?
By thoroughly reflecting upon my learning of week 2’s content, I have learned about the “Many models thinking” approach. It enabled me to learn about models in general and in terms of the types of models and the uses of models. As I have delved deeper, I was able to comprehend the ease that is accompanied by models and how they improve the thinking of one. Moreover, I was able to understand how models enable individuals to become better thinkers. This was intriguing for me as I was able to come into terms of how models assist in communicating information and allow readers to explain phenomena. It was surprising to learn how models impose logical coherence and how they assist in strategic decision making and forecasting. To enhance this learning, I have learnt the various types of models such as the embodiment approach, analogy approach and the alternative reality approach.  Moreover, I gained knowledge in relation to the seven uses of models (reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict and explore). To add to this, the overall science behind models was also learnt during this workshop. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In all honesty, I didn’t possess any knowledge in relation to models and how much depth is to that spectrum of information. Therefore, everything that was grasped about models in relation to how they improve the thinking of an individual was all very foreign to me.   I didn’t know the importance of models in our society and how it is used to communicate information. Overall,  I didn’t know much about models, hence, even the slightest of the information was new. 

## What insights have I gained?
In relation to insights, the overall insight about models was gained this week. As mentioned above, I gained insights into the importance of models. I found the Condorcet jury theorem and diversity prediction theorem highly insightful. It was highly intriguing to see calculations involved in these theorems. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
By participating in this workshop, I have noted that my strength was understanding the basis of models by reflecting upon my performance. However, I found the various concepts discussed in the workshop were rather difficult to grasp and properly understand at once and this can be regarded as my weakness. The area around the Condorcet Jury Theorem and diversity prediction theorem were very difficult yet insightful to comprehend in relation to the calculation.  Moreover, I have released my inability to stay focused and lose interest in the subject due to it being 3 hours long. This was the same weakness as last week due to a lack of attention span. 
 
## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Similarly to last week's workshop, grasping the content of what was taught was a challenging aspect of it. Considering the heavy content involved in this subject and the foreign concept of models, it was hard to comprehend all of it at once. Just like last time, my inability to stay focused for 3 hours straight was also challenging because it is hard to stay focused all throughout the lesson.  However, I dealt with this challenge by reading over the module 2 content and when some parts became challenging to understand, I took assistance from friends who do the subject with me.  Moreover, taking notes for key concepts also assisted dealing with the challenges accompanied with the concepts. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Reflecting upon last week, I wanted to listen better and pay more attention to the lesson and what the tutor was saying to better comprehend the content. However, I failed to do that therefore, this goal also applies for next week. I tried to incorporate my aim of making notes which was helpful and I continue to do that all lessons throughout to strengthen my understanding. This will enable me to maintain consistency. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Similarly to last week, I believe that key note taking is important and useful to assist me with the subject content and understanding. Considering the innumerable foreign concepts involved on this subject such as this workshop makes note taking predominant. Being well organised is key in this subject by keeping track of the assignment dates so that time is managed effectively. Note taking is a technique I use for all my subject units and it aids me immensely in understanding the concepts. 




## Week 3: 

## What have I learnt this week?
By reflecting upon what I learnt during the week 3 workshop, I began learning about thinking electrons and the three types of models (rational, behavioural, and rule-based). I further learnt about decision making and ways in which decision models relate to the way people make or should make certain decisions.  This led to discovering about normative reasons and positive reasons and the classes of problems. Signalling models was also a part of the learning this week. I have learnt that those types of models can identify conditions under which people send expensive signals to “reveal information or their type”. Furthermore, I also learnt about Value and power in terms of models that quantify those two aspects. It was great delving into problem solving and innovation in specific relation to how perspectives, heuristics, team diversity and recombination lead to innovation. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In similar relation to the past two weeks where the majority of concepts discussed in the lesson were unknown and rather intriguing. As I was learning more about models this week, I didn’t have any knowledge in relation to signalling models which was an unfamiliar topic. Although I knew about the basis of decision making at a surface level, I now know about normative reasons and positive reasons. I also now am aware of value and power and moreover, problem solving and innovation. Before these lessons, I wasn't aware of anything about these topics. 

## What insights have I gained?
I found it insightful that normative reasons relate to ways in which models are utilised to come up with prescriptions in order to make better decisions and about positive reasons in relation to the use of models to predict the behavior of others and reasoning behind people’s decision. It was also insightful to learn about signaling models as mentioned above in relation to their use. In my personal opinion and repeatedly speaking, considering the entire content although extension into models, consisted of more unfamiliar concepts which made everything learnt and rasped a new insight during this lesson. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
In relation to my strengths, since this week was branching off models from last week, my understanding of models from last week helped me in understanding this week’s content. However, the concepts discussed in this lesson were also hard to grasp and require more practice to gain understanding. To add to this, lack of attention span was also another weakness observed in this workshop due to the long duration of the workshop which made it fairly difficult to retain the information throughout. I have noticed that this has been a weakness since workshop one. 

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Similarly just like the past two workshops, being able to retain information and staying focused for three hours straight seems to always be a challenge. Therefore, for a change, instead of forcing myself to sit at the workshop for 3 hours, I took two 2-minute breaks in between to get some water or eat something, this enabled me to energise myself and thus I was able to focus on the workshop a bit better. However, there is still struggle to focus during the lessons but I observed that intervals help me focus better and thus strengthen my ability to retain the information that is being taught. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Reflecting upon this week, I believe that taking short breaks during the workshop was useful for retaining information.  I aim to maintain that consistency for upcoming workshops as that technique helped me in retaining information. This would ensure that I actually understand the workshop content and not lose interest. I had some doubts within this workshop wherein I had to ask my fellow mates to explain a few concepts. However next time, I aim to message the tutor and try to understand his points because I feel like his explanation would be more accurate. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Just like the past two weeks, it is proven that note taking is highly beneficial. This is due to the fact that as each module processes, the concepts seem to get harder and harder to process, therefore, consistent note taking helped me immensely. This week’s content of models seemed harder than last week where making notes helped me retain the information at a higher level and develop a better understanding. 




## Week 4

## What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection of the week 4 workshop, as usual, I have learned newer concepts which tend to improve and enhance my ambiguity towards the subject. This week was concerned with the topic  of representing human centred complex systems. I learned about system dynamics and how this specific model consists of sources, sinks, stocks, rates, flows and constants as per the definition. Moreover, this week enhanced my learning towards systems in general developing my knowledge towards my learning of systems in week one. I also learned about networks this week by studying the background of them to understand their high popularity within today’s society. I was taught the various structures of networks such as decentarlies, centralised, the various logics of networks and the functionality of networks, 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Reflecting upon my learning, I have observed that this week I discovered the importance of feedback through casual look diagrams. I didn’t possess any knowledge in relation to the negative and positive feedbacks which were new to learn as mentioned above. Moreover, I didn’t know the reasoning behind why networks have become popular. I found the causal loop diagram very useful as it showcases any errors or the flow of information. 

## What insights have I gained?
In relation to insights for this subject, I found the current modelling of Covis- 19 very insightful and intriguing. This was through the video which was played during the workshop, it helped me understand about agent-based models and how they are more effective responses especially in cases of dealing with a world issue which is inclusive of various autonomous agents. Moreover, I also gained insight into network theory through the video that was provided as it discussed the major topics required to master to look and discover real-world problems. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
In relation to my strengths, I have observed that I was able to understand this week’s content better and retain the information more than last week. I personally found it easier to understand networks and systems in comparison to the arbitrary concepts discussed last week. However, I have noticed that I have a higher tendency to get distracted and procrastinate with work and for some reason, this week seemed worse than the last three weeks. I tried to tackle this weakness by switching phones off at times to avoid any form of distraction coming from social media. 

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The biggest challenge discovered this week was coding. Coming from a background of not being experienced with any form of coding, I found dealing with python fairly difficult. It was genuinely a struggle in the beginning as I was extremely unsure on what to do and how to work with that style of coding. However, this challenge was handled by watching videos on how to work with python and constantly practicing python. Watching various tutorial videos on  Youtube helped me better understand the way to code using python. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In relation to improvements for next time, I would say I would practice more python and ask the tutor for assistance. I believe that practicing using the code will help me become more used to its dynamic and help with the assignment and also other programming subjects. Moreover, I aim to avoid having my phone around me while studying or while participating in the workshop to minimise my level of distractions.  

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The agent-based models seemed to be highly interesting this week. It seemed to be highly useful as it showcased the deficiency of the present Covid-19 modelling and how it can be implemented in the future. It was also useful because it was very relevant to the time period making it more important to understand.  




## Week 5: 

## What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection of the week 5 workshop, I learned about aggregating decisions and behavior. This was in terms of predicting patterns and behaviors and ways to model them wherein logic and alogitism are utilized to predict human behavior in the future linked to the past experiences. I learned about how aggregation of actions allows us as individuals to understand complicated patterns and data in general. Moreover, I was also taught about regularity in relation to normal distributions. I also learnt about linear models although it was for self study and how they are widely utilized statistical techniques which have numerous applications in economics and business.  Finally, I studied power-law distributions relating to long-or-heavy tailed distributions. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
During this workshop, I was astonished about how statistics have the ability to model human decisions because I didn’t know statistics were capable of doing that. I wasn’t aware of the way probability distributions help model our world by allowing people to acquire estimates of the probability that a particular event may take place or to estable occurrences. In all honesty, all the key concepts learnt in this lesson were new for me as I didn’t possess prior knowledge, however, this area of topic interested me heavily throughout the entire workshop. 

## What insights have I gained?
There was a ted talk by Geoff West which was shown during the workshop this week that discusses the utilisation of power laws which is to predict the lifetimes of certain businesses and cities. In my personal opinion, I found it highly insightful as he made statements regarding the cycle of businesses indicating how they proceed and terminate. For such, he even discussed how major firms such as Google and Apple will terminate at a point in time and hearing his words made that very intriguing for me.

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
During this workshop,  we were introduced to our groups and have discussed various topics for our assignment. During this my strength was understanding the basis of the assignment and explaining it to my group members. In relation to my weakness, understanding the concepts discussed in the workshop content was extremely difficult. There seemed to be numerous calculations being involved in the explanation of topics and it was rather confusing for some aspects to grasp the information. 

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
As mentioned prior, the biggest challenge this week was understanding the concepts discussed as I found the information extremely difficult and confusing to grasp. To combat this, I read over the entire content and tried to make notes which did assist my understanding but there were still doubts that weren’t clarified . To tackle this, I tried to contact a tutor and asked him to explain the concepts which were highly useful in enhancing my understanding. Moreover, I still found understanding python very confusing in some areas which I believe I need to practice more and seek more help. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I believe that asking teachers for help is very key and I feel like it assists me immensely to clarify doubts I have in relation to concepts being discussed within the workshop. I didn’t use this approach for this subject before as I was very hesitant but it was proved to be very effective. Moreover, I feel like I should take more initiative in the group work enhancing my leadership skills as that is highly necessary. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
For this week the aggregation of behaviour theory seemed to be the most useful as observed during the workshop. This was due to the fact that this theory had the ability to predict the precise outcomes of agents for the future. Moreover, this led to multiple real-world executions for instance recognising potentially endangering  behaviors and adapting it as soon as possible to assist the global economy.




## Week 6: 

## What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about Markov models, Random Walk models and the riot, broadcast, diffusion, and contagion models. Although concavity and convexity were for self-study, they were also a part of the learning. Markov models are mainly used for situations in which something can be transformed into something else for such sunny weather to rainy weather.  For this model, the general assumptions are that there tends to be a finite number of states, fixed transition probability where it goes from one state to another and is not a simple cycle. In relation to random walk models, these types of models are utilised for situations in which a path is to be determined from a number of random steps. This involves discovering the probabilities of which direction the next step is being taken. Whereas, the riot model is a model which tends to measure individual thresholds for rioting and these models can determine the locations in which riots occur. In terms of the broadcast model, it tends to measure the distribution of ideas or information by the media. On the other hand, the diffusion model is utilized to determine how a particular innovation is taking place in the market. The contagion model is created to measure the spread of diseases and can approximate probabilities of spreading and recovery. Furthermore, I also learnt about the equilibrium which comes under a lyapunov function.  

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In relation to why some countries are rich and poor, I now know that there were models of economic growth to explain that. These relate to exponential growth, economic growth using a primitive economy growth model, solow’s growth model and extensions. I found this information very new. Overall, I am now aware of the fact that most models possess a form of mathematical element and just strengthened my knowledge in relation to models as a whole and how there is a model in place for every situation.   

## What insights have I gained?
In relation to the insights for this workshop, the random walk model video was personally very insightful for me as it gave me a clear introduction to the rationale, maths and read work applications of random walks.  I overall gained insights to perceive the world through six models which was extremely insightful. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
In relation to this week, I have noticed that there are no perceived strengths for this week. This was mainly because there were many new models discussed in this week’s content and they were inclusive of mathematical calculations that made it very difficult to understand the concepts being discussed. Therefore, if anything, a weakness of having to understand and retain the information was more prominent than any strengths as such. Due to a lack of understanding and the difficulty underwent, attention span was also affected making it extremely difficult to focus.  

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
As mentioned above, this week was extremely difficult in relation to the information that was showcased in the workshop. I personally found it extremely exhausting to retain all the information and eventually all motivation to focus because it was way too hard to grasp. I personally don’t think I was able to handle this issue and it wasn’t very productive in that sense. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In relation to next time, I would try to watch more Youtube videos on these model explanations to deepen my understanding of the content especially with the mathematical concepts. In relation to our group assignment, our aim was to determine the other model we are going to utilise for our assignment and to do this, we need a better understanding. Therefore, more group meetings prior to the next lesson would be useful.  

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Note taking is always perceived as a  key technique and therefore, maintaining consistency with it has proved in better understanding the subject content. Moreover, re-visiting subject information is extremely helpful. Due to the group assignment, constantly updating or keeping up with updates with the group is crucial to avoid falling behind in the course.  




## Week 7: 

## What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection of the week 7 workshop, I have learned about complexity and emergent behaviours. I became aware of Segregating and Peer effects in relation to the Schelling’s Segregation Model, Granovetter’s Model and Standing Ovation Model.  Moreover, I have also learnt about coordination and culture and replicator dynamics. rReplicator dynamics are known to be an interesting type of social learning models as they are used for psychology, economics and ecology.  

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Reflecting upon my learning of this week, I now am aware of all the concepts discussed of the topic concerning complexity and emergent behaviors. Specifically, I have observed this week that I discovered how Schelling studied the phenomenon about widespread radical and income segregation for developed parts of the world.  I now know that Schelling’s Segregation Model, Granovetter’s Model and Standing Ovation Models are all inclusive of probability calculations.  

## What insights have I gained?
In relation to insights for this week’s workshop, I found replicator dynamics the most insightful. I found it insightful how they are utilised in three various disciplines of psychology, economics and ecology. Looking into it deeper, I found it difficult yet intriguing about the probability equation utilised for replicator dynamics. Moreover, the fisher’s theory created great interest looking at the variations. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
In relation to my strengths, I have noticed that my attention span for this week wasn’t overly bad, this is because the workshop wasn’t heavy in relation to the content in comparison to last time. However this strength  wasn’t a prominent strength as realised. In terms of my weakness, I have noticed that understanding the probability calculations aspect of the models and concepts explained was difficult and this made me irritated and frustrated. 

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The weaknesses observed this week can also be regarded as challenges. The biggest challenge was understanding the probability calculations as mentioned prior. I found it difficult to comprehend some aspects of the information due to the numerous calculations involved and probability was always one of my weaknesses for understanding, making this week extremely challenging. However, re-reading over the content and making notes assisted with this lesson. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In relation to things I would do better for next time, I wouldn’t want to make major changes, instead be consistent with my learning habits. These habits consist of making notes, asking members of the class/tutor for assistance and re-reading/watching subject content. I believe consistency can aid enhance my understanding of the subject. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The sociological theory of homophily proved to be useful this week. It helped me in understating the concept of “like attracts like’ in opporosointion to ‘opposite attract opposites”. This theory has enabled me to enhance my learning towards the Schelling’s Segregation Model, Granovetter’s Model and Standing Ovation Models. I personally thought this theory was the most useful because I could apply the concepts to my real-life situations.

# 41189 My Reflective Portfolio 
## Week 1 

## What have I learnt this week?
Taking into consideration that this was my first lesson of human-centred complex systems, I would say that I found it rather difficult and overwhelming. This was because the topics discussed in the lesson although some were familiar, the rest was very new and this made it harder to grasp the numerous concepts explored. However, the subject was fascinating and I gained insight into the concept of "systems". I have learnt that systems comprise of multiple elements which makes it complex to simply define it a such. These various aspects of a system must possess a significant relationship and be interlinked to each other and are designed to perform a function. Moreover, insights into types systems were also gained such as open systems, closed systems and isolated systems. Furthermore, the characteristics of a complex system learnt and how they show self-organisation and emergence.

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In all honestly, the subject was entirely new for me therefore most concepts could be considered as foreign. The way I perceived a system to be was different and rather more complex and descriptive than what I had in my knowledge. Therefore, I have gained a deeper knowledge into systems and their complexity and depth. 

## What insights have I gained?
As mentioned previously, I have gained a deeper insight into systems in relation to what they are and how there are numerous forms of systems. My perceptions towards systems being a very simple aspect to them possessing multiple elements was significantly insightful. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
By participating in this workshop, I have noted that my strength was understanding the basis of systems by reflecting upon my performance. However, I found the various concepts discussed in the workshop were rather difficult to grasp and properly understand at once and this can be regarded as my weakness. The area around complex systems was at first very difficult to comprehend. Moreover, I have released my inability to stay focused and lose interest in the subject due to it being 3 hours long. This interest in the subject is increased as time passes by. 
 
## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
By reflecting upon my performance in the workshop, it can be noted that my strengths werenâ€™t very prominent. This is considering the fact that I found the workshop itself fairly difficult in relation to understanding the various concepts discussed. However, after reviewing the content material, I gained a deeper insight and was able to understand complex systems. In relation to my weakness, it can be related to my inability of having to pay attention to a 3-hour workshop with full focus and not be distracted. This lack of attention affected my retention of the subject material.  

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I could be considering grasping the content of the content as a challenging aspect of the entire subject.  This was due to the fact most concepts were foreign and hard to understand simply.  Moreover, as mentioned above, having to pay attention for 3 hours was another major challenge as I would get distracted a lot.  This challenge was dealt with reading through the subject content after the workshop to better comprehend the harder concepts and talk to members of my group if I had any doubts to be clarified. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time my aim is to listen better and pay more detailed attention to the class which can immensely aid in intensifying my understanding of the content showcased. Moreso, I aim to write dot point notes of key concepts which can further aid me. In doing so, I can perfect my time management and perform at a higher standard in the subject. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The main theory I believe that could assist me in performing better in this subject was making notes. This was because this subject involved numerous concepts that are very new to me, therefore note-taking is highly significant. Moreover, keeping up to date with assignment due dates is highly essential for this subject to be organised and manage time and effort effectively. I have used this theory for other subjects and it was highly beneficial, therefore, I am confident that it will work for this subject as well.
